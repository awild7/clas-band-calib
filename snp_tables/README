This code takes a "BAND high-voltage settings" table,
and changes the set voltage by a specified amount of Volts.

Run this code by doing:
./code A B C
where A = change in PMT voltage [Volts]
      B = 1: all bars
	  2: long bars only
	  3: short bars only
      C = /path/to/input/file

The file 'BAND_HV-aftersingleCheckout.snp' can be used
as an input (or example, or template).

Have fun!

The SNPtoSLC.py file takes a SNP file and creates a txt file that
pulls the current HV setting of that SNP file and maps it to sector,layer,component
to be used for other analysis
